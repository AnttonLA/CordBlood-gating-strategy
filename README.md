# CordBlood-gating-strategy

This repository contains code used in the umbilical cord blood GWAS project at the Nilsson Lab, Lund University.

It is meant to accompany the manuscript:
"A genetic atlas of neonatal hematopoiesis reveals early-life determinants of blood cell variation and disease risk"

It includes:
* Jupyter notebook used for the design of the [AliGater](https://github.com/LudvigEk/aligater) flow cytometry gating 
strategy for cord blood samples (`Gating_Strat_Design.ipynb`).
* The final AliGater gating strategy file, used for gating the cord blood samples (`batch_gating_FINAL.py`).
* Scripts used for the post-processing of the flow cytometry data (`CB_data_batch_effect_correction.py`).
